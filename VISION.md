# A Vision for Chef Management Console

The Chef Management Console is a user's primary visual interface to a Chef Server. As such, its role is to provide the HTML representation of a user's infrastructure. This is in support of the Chef Server, which through its API provides the JSON representation of a user's infrastructure.

The Chef Management Console enables focus, flexibility, and learning.

It achieves this by:

* Presenting Chef concepts in a visual way
* Being built of focused components
* Being built upon REST principles

All of which enables novel and informative interfaces to be built, ensuring users are successful with Chef.

The Chef Management Console is the first visual platform for Chef that will lay the foundation upon which other visual platforms for Chef will be built.

## Guiding Principles

We aim not only to provide a representation of our users' infrastructures, but to go well beyond that expectation to deliver a rich, intuitive, highly responsive and reliable experience that even the most CLI-centric among them would be happy to pay for and use. Some motivating characteristics we're considering include:

  * Reinforcing Chef concepts by using common Chef terminology and taxonomy
  * Encouraging functionality consistent with Chef philosophy (e.g., respecting the source-code-as-truth principle)
  * Mobile/tablet-friendly interaction design, with more immersive experiences targeting the desktop; we should delight by exploiting the visual and interactive potential of the browser and modern Web
  * A strong focus on intuitiveness and performance &mdash; it has to be smart, and it has to be fast
  * Seamless interoperability with other Chef Web properties (e.g., Identity, Billing, Analytics, Support, static/info sites)
